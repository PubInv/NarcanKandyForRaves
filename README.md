<h1 align=center>PLUR-N Case</h1>

*PLUR-N is the second generationof my design for the Narcan Kandy for Raves with additional features.* 

A portable and stylish case for Narcan, designed to reduce opioid overdoses at festivals, raves, and other events where quick access to life-saving medication can make all the difference.

<p>The Narcan Kandy for Raves project is an initiative under Public Invention and Helpful Invention aims to provide both a practical tool and a conversation starter around harm reduction.</p>

## Project Vision
The goal is to save lives by:
- Create a compact, easy-to-carry Narcan case that fits seamlessly into festival attire (bracelets, necklaces, belt etc.).
- Promoting awareness and normalize harm reduction practices in festival and rave culture.
- Leverage community input to enhance design, usability, and effectiveness.

## Design Features
- Portable, fits easily in pockets, bags, or ideally, wearable rave gear.
- Sturdy and high quality to stay on while dancing.
- Quick access in high-stress situations.
- Basic opioid overdose response instructions included.
- Pretty!

## Lessons Learned from Version 1 Results  
Current case designs online are the correct shape for to hold a Narcan cartridge but there are some missing features. 
- unattractive and plain
- dark color that blends in, not easily visible in low light situations
- only attachable onto a belt loop or band
- the nozzle is exposed to the air = unhygenic
   
## The Design 

    
## Requirements
- protect the cartridge from escaping while dancing and also from water or dirt


There are two options which affect case shape, size, and functionality
  1. cartridge intack inside of the original plastic containing use directions
   Pros
    - unit, especially nozzle which goes inside of the nose, is protected from the elements
   Cons
    - requires user to remove from case then remove from plastic protective packaging
    - bulkier than the usual design 
  2. removed from original packaging with paper separate use directions
   Pros
    - 
   Cons
    -  
a covering or top to protect the cartridge from escaping while dancing and also from water or dirt
- ravers wear clothing that is tight and not conventional so the case needs to attach in be easily accessible and able to be worn in multiple ways to ways - as a necklace, bracelet, and waistband
- shape: single and double cases in case one application is not enough to avoid overdose
